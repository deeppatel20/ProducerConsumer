## ProducerConsumer

-Producer and Consumer Problem<br/>

    -The producer and consumer problem is one of the small collection of standard, well-known problems in concurrent programming. A finite-size buffer and two classes of threads, producers and consumers, put items into the buffer (producers) and take items out of the buffer (consumers).
    -A producer cannot put something in the buffer until the buffer has space available. A consumer cannot take something out of the buffer until the producer has written to the buffer.
